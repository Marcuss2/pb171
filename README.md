# pb171

This was a project course focused on writing a HAL for an embedded chip, the chip in question is ATmega328P. The project is written in C++20

We were forbidden from using any libraries, I couldn't even properly use the standard library, so some concepts are copied from there. Single exception was the use of interrupts.
